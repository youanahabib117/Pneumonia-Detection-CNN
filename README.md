# Pneumonia-Detection-CNN
For this project, we search for the most optimal CNN architecture that can detect the presence of pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Keras from Tensorflow. The objective is to detect the presence of this disease with sufficient accuracy while putting emphasis on recall score to minimize the risk of failing to identify patients with pneumonia.
